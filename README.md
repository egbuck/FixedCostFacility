# Fixed Cost Facility Location Problem
Add (with and without substitution) and Drop Heuristics for the Fixed Cost Facility Location Problem.  Implemented in Python with functions.

2 examples shown with testing all 3 of these algorithms.  One needs to give the shortest path distance matrix, the fixed costs for each facility, and the demands for each facility.
